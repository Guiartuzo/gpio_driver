This repo is a simple gpio driver made for raspberry pi zero to control gpios through a kernel module from user space. The intent behind this is just for studying the development of kernel modules and how to use them in a practical way.

### procfs

procfs is a process file system generated dynamically by the kernel that gives access to kernel parameters, process and hardware information, system memory, CPU stats, etc.

Some tools that use procfs are: __ps__, __top__, __htop__, __free__, __uptime__, __lscpu__.

This driver will make use of procfs for controlling gpios from user space.
